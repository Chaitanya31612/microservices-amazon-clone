## Steps to run the project

1. Have skaffold installed and run `skaffold dev` in the root directory of the project
2. for running in ubuntu install minikube and run `minikube start` and then `skaffold dev`
3. Use `skaffold dev --port-forward` to forward the ports to the host machine

OR
4. run `minukube service -all` to get the url of the service and open it in the browser
5. run `minikube dashboard` to see the dashboard of the cluster
6. run `minikube stop` to stop the cluster
7. run `minikube delete` to delete the cluster
8. run `minikube addons list` to see the addons installed

## Creating secret in kube cluster

1. Create a secret in the cluster using the command `kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=JWT_KEY=your_secret_key`
2. Secret for products service
```
‚ùØ kubectl create secret generic products-secrets \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_USERNAME=username \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

## Docker, Kubernetes, and Skaffold Documentation

### Docker
- Docker is used to containerize the services in this project.
- Each service has its own `Dockerfile` to build the Docker image.
- Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.

### Kubernetes
- Kubernetes is used to orchestrate the deployment of services.
- The project uses Minikube for local Kubernetes cluster management.
- Use `minikube start` to start the cluster and `minikube stop` to stop it.
- Secrets are managed using Kubernetes secrets, e.g., `jwt-secret` and `products-secrets`.

### Skaffold
- Skaffold is used for continuous development on Kubernetes.
- Run `skaffold dev` to build and deploy the application continuously.
- Use `skaffold dev --port-forward` to forward ports to the host machine.

## Common Shared Library

### Overview
- A common shared library is used across different services for shared functionality.
- It is published on npm under the organization and name `@cgecommerceproject/common`.

### Usage
- Install the library in other projects using `npm install @cgecommerceproject/common`.
- After updates, publish the library using `npm publish --access public`.
- Update the library in other projects with `npm update @cgecommerceproject/common`.

## Auth Service Documentation

### Overview
The Auth service is responsible for handling authentication and authorization within the application. It is built using Node.js and Express, with TypeScript for type safety.

### Key Features
- User authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Input validation using `express-validator`.
- Session management with `cookie-session`.

### Setup and Installation
1. **Dependencies**: The service relies on several npm packages, including:
   - `express`
   - `jsonwebtoken`
   - `mongoose`
   - `@cgecommerceproject/common` for shared functionality.

2. **Scripts**:
   - `npm start`: Starts the service using `ts-node-dev` for automatic restarts on file changes.

### Running the Service
- Start the service with `npm start`.
- The service will listen for requests and handle authentication operations.

### Security
- JWTs are used for secure authentication.
- Ensure the `JWT_KEY` environment variable is set for token signing.


## Products Service Documentation

### Overview
The Products service manages product data and operations. It is built using Spring Boot and Java, leveraging Spring Data JPA for database interactions.

### Key Features
- RESTful API for product management.
- Integration with PostgreSQL for data persistence.
- Security features using Spring Security.

### Setup and Installation
1. **Dependencies**: The service uses several Maven dependencies, including:
   - `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`
   - `spring-boot-starter-web`
   - `spring-boot-starter-security`
   - `postgresql` for database connectivity.

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Managed using Maven with a `pom.xml` file.
   - Java version 21 is required.

3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
   - Configure PostgreSQL database credentials in the application properties.

### Security
- JWTs are used for secure API access.
- Ensure the `products-secrets` are configured in the Kubernetes cluster for database credentials.
